# Getting Started

This guide covers the basics of updating your portfolio website.

## Overview

Your portfolio is built with modern web technologies and is designed to be easily customizable. Each section can be updated by editing specific files.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional appearance
- **Interactive Elements**: Smooth animations and hover effects
- **Performance Optimized**: Fast loading and efficient code

## How Updates Work

When you make changes to your content files:
1. The website automatically rebuilds
2. Changes appear in the preview immediately
3. All links and functionality are preserved

## File Structure

Your main content files are located in:
- `src/components/` - Main section components
- `src/hooks/` - Data and functionality hooks
- `public/` - Static files (images, videos)

## Best Practices

- **Test changes** in the preview before publishing
- **Keep file sizes small** for better performance
- **Use consistent formatting** across all content
- **Verify all links** work correctly after updates
